    The operators ++ and -- can be placed either before or after a variable.

When the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: counter++.
The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: ++counter.
Both of these statements do the same thing: increase counter by 1.

Is there any difference? Yes, but we can only see it if we use the returned value of ++/--.

Let’s clarify. As we know, all operators return a value. Increment/decrement is no exception. The prefix form returns the new value while the postfix form returns the old value (prior to increment/decrement).

To see the difference, here’s an example:

let counter = 1;
let a = ++counter; // (*)

alert(a); // 2
In the line (*), the prefix form ++counter increments counter and returns the new value, 2. So, the alert shows 2.

Now, let’s use the postfix form:

let counter = 1;
let a = counter++; // (*) changed ++counter to counter++

alert(a); // 1
